Metropolis Algorithm project

This project was created in order to find the optimal quantum spin configurations by: 
1. Implementing the Metropolis algorithm in a single thread, enabling it to run a user-defined number of times
2. Implement parallel processing by creating multiple threads, allowing the optimal solution to be found quicker.
